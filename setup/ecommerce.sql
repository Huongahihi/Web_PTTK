All of the thrust developed from the PWC is routed through the hose, so the PWC just follows behind the rider in trail giving you the freedom to go anywhere, even underwater. The Flyboard has its own buoyancy and therefore floats on the water allowing the rider more safety and easier time in the water prior to start.

Visitors are allowed to come into close contact with one of the world’s most majestic creatures. Situated approximately two hours from Kuala Lumpur city center. The early history was set up by Malaysian Wildlife Society, it is the base of operations of the Department Of Wildlife and National Parks Elephant Relocation Team, which assists in the capture and relocation of rogue elephants from across Southeast Asia. <br /><br />Departing at 9am, our first stop out of the city is at the iconic Batu Caves in Gombak. An important place of worship for Hindu devotees in Malaysia, this natural attraction is made up of a series of limestone caves said to be more than 400 million years old. The towering golden statue of Lord Muruga is regarded as the tallest statue of a Hindu deity in Malaysia. Guarding the entrance of the main cave it glints ethereally against the cloudy sky. Two cave temples called Art Gallery Cave and Museum Cave are also contained in the main complex, as well as a Tamil school, several souvenir shops and vegetarian eateries.<br /><br />We are then ushered into an air-conditioned audio-visual theater for a 25-minute video documentary on the National Parks Elephant Relocation Team’s conservation activities and programs. The informative presentation allows us to have a better understanding of the work conducted at the center, the duty of the team’s trained elephants and the highly hazardous responsibility of the rangers when they are out in the field conducting wild elephant relocations.<br /><br />We take a five-minute walk to the elephant enclosure where five rehabilitated elephants are kept. Visitors can feed these elephants by purchasing sugar canes, bananas, and peanuts from a stall nearby. Soon after, the elephants are led towards a nearby river where they are groomed and bathed by professional handlers. For an additional charge, visitors can experience the thrill of bathing with the elephants, all under watchful eyes and careful supervision. Please note that the elephant bathing is an optional activity.<br /><br />The Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary Tour is a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur city, get back in touch with nature, as well as discover the important roles that the elephant sanctuary play in ensuring the survival and well being of these majestic animals.<br/><br/><b>Departure Time</b>: Between 9am and 9.30am<br/><br/><b>Departure Point</b>: * Kuala Lumpur Hotel<br/><br/><b>Operations</b>: Daily<br/><br/><b>Vourcher</b>: You can present either a paper or an electronic voucher for this activity.<br/><br/><b>Excerpt</b>: Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary Pahang is Malaysia Premier Elephant Conservation Center.
